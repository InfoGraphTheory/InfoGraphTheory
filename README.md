# Info Graph
This repository is dedicated to explaining the theory of the graph like structure called Info Graph.
The primary terms being described here will be the *Info Graph*, *Info Triples* and *Info Tables*.

In common mathematical terms the Info Graph can be described as a 3-uniform hypergraph.
The project here aims to go a bit of the common track and present the Info Graph as a graph type on its own. 
The description will be accompanied by plentyful references to common descrete mathematics.
